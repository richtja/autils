Utility Libraries to power your tests (or general applications)

AAutils, collection of well tested python utilities that will
keep test writers efforts in the features to be tested, and away
from debugging and troubleshooting the libraries themselves.

The primary goal of AAutils is to be a place for modules
that ease the interaction with system level features and interfaces. Which
is commonly needed in test automation.

The list of available utilities and supported platforms can be seen at
